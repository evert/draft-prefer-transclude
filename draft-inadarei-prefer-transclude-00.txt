            Transclude Preference for the HTTP Prefer Header
                       inadarei-prefer-transclude

Abstract

   The Transclude preference is a registered behavior for the HTTP
   Prefer header field.  Its purpose is for clients to specify
   preferences that certain links in a response should be resolved by
   the server, instead of being served as links that the client can
   resolve.

1.  Introduction

   "Prefer Header for HTTP" [RFC7240] proposes an HTTP header that can
   be used to indicate that particular server behaviors are preferred by
   the client but are not required for successful completion of the
   request.  It further defines several standard Preferences, such as
   the "return" preference.  The "return" preference lets the server
   know that the client would prefer a specific representation of a
   resource in a response payload, e.g. full representation vs. a
   minimal one.

   Preferences like the "return" one are critical for mobile scenarios
   as mobile applications are very sensitive to network latency,
   throughput and anything that can improve end-user experience, even on
   resource-constrained networks.  Prefer header allows servers to tune
   and optimize its response payload based on client preferences, for
   instance: to only send mobile app a minimal response when it doesn't
   need full resource.

   The size of the payload is not the only preference that can improve
   user-experience in mobile scenarios, however.  Closely related to the
   size of the payload, is the number of HTTP requests a client needs to
   make to get all of the required data.  This is the challenge that
   "transclude" preference addresses.

   When server sends hypermedia responses (e.g. in the case of
   Hypermedia APIs) some of the response data may be referenced via a
   URI link instead of being embedded in the payload itself.  The need
   to grab data from a link can degrade experience of mobile
   applications, since they are forced to make multiple requests to per
   single end-user request.  This is sometimes referred to as "chatty
   interface" and is a significant problem for mobile and Internet of
   Things scenarios.

   Transclude preference notifies the server that the client would
   prefer the server to proactively transclude certain content
   represented by links of indicated link relation types.  The notion of
   "link relation type", in this context is as defined by [RFC5988]

   As a result of using a transclude preference, a client receives all
   of the required data already embedded in the response output, without
   the need to make additional network calls.

2.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Transclude Usage Example

   Following is an example of a client asking server to transclude data
   represented at the copyright, edit-form and "other-form" links.
   Since "other-form" is not a standard, IANA link relation type, client
   is using a URI for identifying the link relation type.

   Get /blog/1223 HTTP/1.1
   Host: api.example.org
   Content-Type: application/json
   Prefer: transclude="copyright;edit-form;http://rels.io/other-form"
   Vary: Prefer,Accept,Accept-Encoding

   As you can see from the example, the transclude preference expects
   the value to be enclosed in double quotes, if there are multiple link
   relation types provided.  Further, standard link relations SHOULD be
   indicated by name while custom link relation types SHOULD be

   indicated with a unique URI representing that link relation.
   Multiple link relation types MUST be separated by semicolons.

   Example response may look something like the following:

   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   Server: nginx/1.10.3 (Ubuntu)
   Date: Sat, 27 Jun 2015 11:05:32 GMT
   Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
   Transfer-Encoding: chunked
   Connection: close
   Vary: Prefer,Accept,Accept-Encoding
   Preference-Applied: transclude="copyright;edit-form"
   Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
   Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Content-Type

   As you can see from this output, the server only transcluded
   copyright and edit-form link relation types, but not the custom type
   client requested.  This is because preferences are just suggestions
   and server has no obligation related to them.  In this case, we can
   assume that the server skipped the last link relation type because
   maybe it wasn't familiar with it, or for some other reason.

4.  Implementation Considerations

   Transclude preference is media-type agnostic.  It should work with
   any response content-type.  The mechanics of transclusion, however
   will either depend on capabilities of the response media-type or
   require a multi-part response with multiple media types in the
   response.
